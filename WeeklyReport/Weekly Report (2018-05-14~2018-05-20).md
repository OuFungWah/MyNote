## Impresion

This week, I find another two roomate to rent a room, this is a good news for me. But there is also a bad news for me, that is my final exam is late!!! it is on 5.24 originally, but now is become 5.28 or later. The worse is I had already bought a air ticket, if I need to refund, I will lose almost ¥300. I hate that college!
