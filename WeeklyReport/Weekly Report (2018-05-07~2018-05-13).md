## Impresion

This week, I found two friends to renting together with me. Saturday, they found a rent room and ready to settle down. But, something bad happened, that room’s owner want us give four months’s rent first, and I have to pay what I should pay is ¥7,333. All I can give from my family is only ¥4,000. So that, I have no idea how to get the rest of my part. Because I can’t get enough money, so what they can do is just kick me out of the group. This time, because of my mistake maybe I am going to loss two new friend. Next time, if I still want to join somebody I must be more careful, I hate losing friend, anyone of them!
Tencent give me a interview after I get the Netease’s offer, I decided to go to the interview not because I want to get Tencent’s offer, it is because I want to know about the limit of myself
